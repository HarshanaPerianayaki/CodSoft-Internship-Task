Task 1: TO-DO LIST

A To-Do List application is a useful project that helps users manage and organize their tasks efficiently. 
This project aims to create a command-line or GUI-based application using Python, allowing users to create, update, and track their to-do lists.

1. Command-Line To-Do List Application

    In this version, users will interact with the application through the command line by typing in commands.

    Steps to implement:
       
          *Define the Task Class:
                This class will represent each task with attributes like title, description, and completion status.

          *Task Management Functions:
                Functions to add, remove, list, update, and mark tasks as completed.

          *Storage:
                Store the tasks in a list or use a file to persist them across sessions (for example, a simple text file or JSON file).

          *User Interface:
                Provide a simple menu-driven interface to allow the user to interact with the app.
