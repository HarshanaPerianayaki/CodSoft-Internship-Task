Task 5: Contact Management System

In this task, we will create a Contact Management System that allows users to manage their contacts. The system will allow users to:

    *Store contact information, including name, phone number, email, and address.
    *Add new contacts.
    *View a list of saved contacts.
    *Search for contacts by name or phone number.
    *Update contact details.
    *Delete contacts.
We'll build a command-line interface for this application, and we will store the contact data in a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents a contact.

Features to Implement:

    *Store Contact Information: 
         Each contact will include the name, phone number, email, and address.
    *Add a New Contact: 
         Users can add new contacts with their details.
    *View Contact List: 
         Users can view a list of saved contacts, displaying names and phone numbers.
    *Search Contacts:
         Users can search for a contact by name or phone number.
    *Update Contact:
         Users can update a contact's details.
    *Delete Contact: 
         Users can delete a contact from the list.
    *User Interface:
         A simple, user-friendly command-line interface.
