Task 2: Design a Simple Calculator with Basic Arithmetic Operations.

In this task, we'll design a simple command-line calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

Steps to implement the calculator:

       *Prompt the user for input:
             Ask the user to input two numbers.
             Ask the user to choose an arithmetic operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division).

       *Perform the calculation:
             Depending on the chosen operation, perform the corresponding arithmetic calculation.

       *Display the result:
             Show the result of the calculation.

       *Error handling:
             Handle errors like division by zero or invalid input.

Features and Improvements:

        *Input Validation:
             The program handles invalid inputs (like non-numeric values) using a try-except block.

        *Error Handling for Division: 
             The calculator avoids division by zero errors and provides a meaningful message.

        *Reusability:
             The calculator allows multiple calculations in a loop, making it user-friendly.

        *Extensibility: 
             You can easily extend the calculator with more operations (like exponentiation, modulus, etc.) if needed.
