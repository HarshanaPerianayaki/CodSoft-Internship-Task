                    Scissors beat Paper.
                    Paper beats Rock.
    4.Result Display: The game will show both the user's and the computer's choices and display whether the user wins, loses, or ties.
    5.Score Tracking (Optional): Keep track of the score for multiple rounds.
    6.Play Again: Ask the user if they want to play another round.
    7.User Interface: The interface will be simple and clear, with prompts and results displayed at each step.
